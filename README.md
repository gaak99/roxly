# Intro
s/oxly/roxly -- under construction -- uses the Dropbox API to auto-merge Dropbox file revisions with a git-like cli.

Though much of this README is geared toward Orgzly/Emacs usage many of the features can be used for general Dropbox revision groking.

You can edit and save the same file simultaneously on two Dropbox clients -- usually Emacs/laptop and Orgzly/mobile -- and then later run oxly on laptop to view/diff/merge/push revisions.

oxly is most useful when you try to Orgzly `Sync` and it fails with the following error message
```
Both local and remote notebook have been modified.
```

The oxly `merge` cmd uses diff3(1) and will try to auto-merge. If it can't auto-merge all hunks the conflicts can be resolved by hand with the Emacs ediff-merge-with-ancestor cmd (nice UI) or $EDITOR diff3-output (not so nice UI).

My use case is two Dropbox clients (Emacs/Unix, Ogzly/Android) so more/other clients not tested but maybe can be done carefully and two at a time. Also see Caveats/Gotchas below.

## Status
Used dailyish by the developer (w/2 Dropbox clients, Emacs laptop and Orgzly mobile) but that's total usage asfaik -- more users are welcome -- any bug/issue/suggestion/question post it at https://github.com/gaak99/oxly/issues).

You probably want to try master HEAD before fetching a release.

oxly does no Deletes via Dropbox API and all edits/merges are saved as a new revision, so should be low risk to give it a try. And note if a mismerge is saved you can easily revert to the revision you want, see Caveats/Gotchas below.

### Update April 2018

It's been over a year since any big changes so seems pretty solid at least for my usage -- when I'm in note-taking-mode I use it almost daily and works good. My only complaint is diff3 seems to not auto-merge as frequently as I hoped. But I've gotten good at emacs ediff to resolve conflicts so not a big problem.

## Backstory
*Every time* you edit/save or copy over an existing file (_citation needed_) a new revision is quietly made by Dropbox.
And Dropbox will save them for 1 month (free) or 1 year (paid).
And as a long time casual Dropbox user this was news to me recently.

And my fave org-mode mobile app Orgzly supports Dropbox but not git(1) (yet) so I needed a way to merge notes that are modified on both laptop and mobile.

And if you squint hard enough Dropbox's auto-versioning looks like lightweight commits and maybe we can simulate a (limited) DVCS here enough to be useful.

## Theory of operation
On Dropbox we keep a small&simple filename=content_hash kv db called the ancdb.
The content_hash is the official Dropbox one.

`oxly clone/merge/push` will (pseudocode):
```bash
	# fpath is file path being merged
	fa = dropbox_download(revs[latest])       # latest from Orgzly
	fb = dropbox_download(revs[latest_rev-1]) # latest from Emacs
	fanc = dropbox_download(ancdb_get(fpath))
	rt = diff3 -m fa fanc fb #> fout
	if rt == 0: # no conflicts
		pass
	elseif rt == 1:
		# hand edit fout or 3-way ediff
	dropbox_upload(fout)
	ancdb_set(fpath); dropbox_upload(ancdb)
```

## Merge Flow
 1. On Orgzly (when regular `Sync` fails) select `Force Save`.

 2. On laptop run oxmerge (wrapper around oxly). If auto-merge aka diff3(1) does not resolve all conflicts, resolve them by hand.

 3. On Orgzly run `Sync`.

# Oxly Usage
```bash
$ oxly --help
$ oxly sub-cmd --help
```

## Quick Start
### One time
* Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaak99/oxly.git
export SUDO=sudo           # set for your env
cd oxly && $SUDO python setup.py install
export MYBIN=/usr/local/bin # set for your env
$SUDO cp oxly/scripts/oxmerge.sh $MYBIN/oxmerge
$SUDO chmod 755 $MYBIN/oxmerge
```

* Dropbox API app and OAuth 2 token

Create a Dropbox API app (w/full access to files and types) from Dropbox app console
   `<https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps>`
and generate an access token for yourself.

And add it to ~/.oxlyconfig. Note no quotes needed around $token.

```
[misc]
auth_token=$token
```

### One time per file
1. Make sure Orgzly has a clean `Sync` of file.

2. Run oxly cmds to init file in the ancestor db on laptop something like this:
 
	```bash
	$ mkdir /tmp/myoxlyrepo ;  cd /tmp/myoxlyrepo
	$ oxly clone --init-ancdb dropbox://orgzly/foo.org
	```

3. Make edits and save same file as needed on Emacs and Orgzly like usual.

### As needed (dailyish)
#### Save same file/note on Emacs and Orgzly
* The key point here is the latest Emacs version and latest Orgzly version need to be the last two revisions in Dropbox for the oxmerge script to work good.  (note advanced users can merge any two revisions via oxly)

1. Save file shared via Dropbox on laptop/Emacs (~/Dropbox) as needed.

2. On mobile/Orgzly save (locally) the same note as needed.

3. When ready to sync/merge, on Orgzly select `Sync` notes on Orgzly main menu.

4. If the sync fails and the Orgzly error msg says it's modified both local and remote -- *this* is the case we need oxly -- then `Force Save` (long press on note) on Orgzly.

   The forced save is safe cuz the prev edits will be saved by Dropbox as seperate revisions.

   But once you do this don't make any more changes (via Emacs/Orgzly/etc) to the file as it may cause problems with the merge. See section Caveats/Gotchas below.
	
#### Merge revisions
Now the 2 most recent revisions -- one each from Emacs and Orgzly -- in Dropbox are ready to be merged with oxly:

1. Run oxly cmds via oxmerge script on laptop something like this:

	```bash
	$ cd /tmp/myoxlyrepo 
	$ oxmerge dropbox://orgzly/foo.org
	```
	
2a. If oxmerge finished with no conflicts -- *YAAAY* -- goto step 3 below.

2b. If oxmerge finished with conflicts -- *BOOOO* -- choose one of the options output to resolve the conflict(s).

3. Finally on Orgzly select `Sync` (`Force Load` not necessary) to load merged/latest revision from Dropbox. This should be done before any other changes are saved to Dropbox.

Congrats your file is merged.

### Tips/Tricks

#### Using oxly

##### oxly cmds log (--oneline is nice), diff, and cat are handy to view a revision metadata/data
* See `oxly cmd --help`.

##### Tips for a clean -- no conflicts are a wonderful thang -- merge
* I have a misc notes file I slang url's and ideas to several times a day on Emacs and Orgzly and oxmerge once a day. And I'm mostly adding new (org top level) entries and much less changing older ones. To get a better chance of a clean (auto) merge I usually append note entries on Orgzly and prepend (below org TITLE header(s)) on Emacs. Also on Emacs I make sure the body of the note added has a empty line before and after as Orgzly likes it that way. So when Orgzly later groks it no changes are done that many result in an annoying dirty merge.

##### Network partitions while running oxmerge or clone/push
* You can usually just retry the oxly cmd. If oxmerge fails you should prolly run the individual oxly cmds unless it failed during `clone` phase.

###### Push of merged data succeeds but ancdb_push fails
* At the end of `push` it will run `ancdb_push`.  If the the data file upload succeeds but ancdb upload fails, you can run `ancdb_push` by hand.


#### Using ediff
* ediff skillz def a plus here. But if you are not currently used to using ediff then this is good way to learn it. It's def a non-trivial -- UI-wise and concept-wise  -- but very useful Emacs app.
* Orgzly seems to add blank line(s) so don't ediff merge them out on Emacs else u will keep seeing them come back -- zombielike --  to haunt you and must re-merge again and again.
* BTW if you don't dig your ediff config try mines (that I found on the Net)

```lisp
;; don't start another frame
;; this is done by default in preluse
(setq ediff-window-setup-function 'ediff-setup-windows-plain)
;; put windows side by side
(setq ediff-split-window-function (quote split-window-horizontally))
;; revert windows on exit - needs winner mode
(winner-mode)
(add-hook 'ediff-after-quit-hook-internal 'winner-undo)
(add-hook 'ediff-prepare-buffer-hook #'show-all)
```

### Caveats/Gotchas

####  No data file or ancdb file locking
* A lock of the data file being merged and ancdb would be useful for data safety here but I don't see it in the Dropbox v2 api (tis a hard problem in distributed systems but NFS Lock Mgr come back ALL IS FORGIVEN) sooooo ...
 
##### One `oxmerge url` at a time
* ancdb is a shared resource and currently it's only fully safe to oxmerge (aka oxit clone/merge/push) one file at a time. Some consistency checks are done and more planned but maynot remove all data races and such.

##### No edits to a data file while running oxmerge (or oxly clone-->push)
* For a succesful merge, once the oxmerge process (aka 2 latest revisions downloaded) begins the user needs to be careful and not change the file anymore outside of the process until process completes.

#### Developed/tested on MacOS and Linux so non-Unix-like systems may be trouble

### Troubleshooting

#### ancdb problems

##### File key/hash not found
If the file/hash key not found in ancdb or hash seems incorrect you can't do usual `merge` but we can 2-way `merge2`and reset the file/hash key:
```bash
# Note this assumes last Orgzly/Orgzly versions are current/current-1 revs in Dropbox.
# If not, see `log` cmd and use --rev `merge2` options.
$ oxly clone dropbox://orgzly/foo.org # get latest ancdb
$ oxly merge2 orgzly/foo.org # merge by hand w/emacsclient
$ oxly push --add orgzly/foo.org # will reset ancdb
```

or if you don't need to merge now but want to reset ancdb for this file:
```bash
$ oxly clone --init-ancdb  dropbox://orgzly/foo.org # get latest ancdb
```

#### Revert revision as fallback
* If a mismerge is saved you can easily revert to the revision you want using oxly or the Dropbox.com site UI.

##### Revert revision using oxly
```bash
$ oxly clone dropbox://orgzly/foo.org
$ oxly log --oneline orgzly/foo.org #find rev needed
# oxly cat and diff handy here
$ oxly cat --rev $rev orgzly/foo.org > orgzly/foo.org
$ oxly push --no-dry-run --add orgzly/foo.org
# view/check it
$ oxly clone dropbox://orgzly/foo.org
$ oxly cat orgzly/foo.org
```
	
##### Revert revision on dropbox.com
* Login using web ui, look for menu right of file

#### Network partitions while running oxmerge or clone/push
* You can usually just retry the cmd

##### Push of merged data succeeds but ancdb_push fails
* At the end of `push` it will run `ancdb_push`.  If the the data file upload succeeds but ancdb upload fails, you can run `ancdb_push` by hand.


#### Design
* oxly is not git -- no real commits, no branches, single user, etc. But as far as a poor-man's DVCS goes, oxly can be useful when git is not avail. Oxly just implements enough of a subset of git to support a basic clone-merge-add-push flow (and a few others to view the revisions and merged file). New files in wd/index not supported.

* My use case is Emacs on a Unix laptop and Android Orgzly on mobile phone so far only only that config has much real world use. More clients should be viable as long as two at a time are merged/pushed in a careful manner (don't save any non-oxly changes to Dropbox while this is being done). There's no locking done here so the user has to be careful and follow the procedure above.

* Only handles a single file on Dropbox as remote repo (might be expanded to a dir tree in future). 


# Tests for developers

```bash
$ export PYTHONPATH=/tmp/pypath
$ mkdir /tmp/py3path && python3 setup.py develop --install-dir /tmp/py3path

# If you bumpup the version of dev pkg and have a prev version installed globally,
# you will probably have to uninstall global version to test dev version.
$ roxly --version
oxly, version 0.10.10
$ sudo python -m pip uninstall oxly
$ /tmp/py3path/roxly --version
oxly, version 0.10.11

# note valid Dropbox auth token needed in ~/.oxlyconfig
$ cd /tmp/py3path
$ PATH=/tmp/py3path:$PATH  ./roxly --version
$ PATH=/tmp/py3path:$PATH bash roxly/tests/run-tests.sh
```

The hackers behind Dropbox, Orgzly, emacs/org-mode/ediff, Python/Click, git/github/git-remote-dropbox, and others I'm probably forgetting.
  
# Future work
## Features
* Remote repo can be a dir (not just a file as currently)

## More tests
* init tests - finer grained and mocked so can be done locally
* tests for each big fix

## Next level sh*t
* A magit style emacs ui?
* oxlyless?!? (inspired by gitless) 
* CRDT!?! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type
